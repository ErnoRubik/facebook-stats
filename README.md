# facebook-stats
Originally written years ago, this was my first foray into the then-new Facebook Graph.

The project was originally spec'd to evolve into a fully-fledge application, where users could add all of their pages and pull their Facebook Graph data for each into a single interface.

The project was scrapped the day after it was started in favor of other projects.
